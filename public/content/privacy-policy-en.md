# Pixor Privacy Policy

- Last Updated: September 20, 2025
- Effective Date: September 20, 2025

Welcome to Pixor. This Privacy Policy explains how Soyotube and its affiliates ("we," "our," or "us") collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when we provide Pixor (the "Software") and related services worldwide. Please read this Policy carefully before using the Software, especially the sections that describe your rights and obligations.

## 1. Scope

This Policy applies when you install, register, access, or use the Software on macOS devices, as well as when you interact with other products or services we provide. If a particular service is accompanied by a dedicated privacy notice or supplemental terms, that document will prevail for the relevant service.

## 2. Information We Collect

We follow the principle of data minimization. The current version only stores the limited information needed to run the Software locally:

1. **Runtime and preference data**: Personalized configurations such as shortcuts, interface layout, and language, stored in local `UserDefaults`.
2. **Recent access records**: Security-scoped bookmarks saved locally to help you reopen image folders within the macOS sandbox.
3. **Trial and in-app purchase data**: Trial start/end timestamps, purchase dates, and transaction identifiers stored locally—and, when necessary, in the keychain—to provide the 7-day free trial and the one-time unlock.
4. **Receipt validation data**: If receipt validation is enabled, the Software reads the App Store receipt and sends the receipt plus the shared secret to Apple's official verification endpoint to confirm purchase validity.
5. **Information you provide voluntarily**: Details you share when contacting us via email or other channels, retained only as needed to handle your request and improve the Software.

We do not intentionally collect image content, account passwords, or data unrelated to core functionality. Should we introduce cloud sync, account systems, or third-party integrations in the future, we will obtain your explicit consent and update this Policy in advance.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use the collected information to:

- Support core features, including determining trial eligibility, validating purchases, restoring entitlements, loading recent folders, and remembering preferences;
- Enhance security and compliance through keychain storage and clock-roll-back detection that protect against unauthorized use;
- Provide support and resolve issues, including responding to inquiries, appeals, or disputes;
- Perform aggregated analytics to assess performance and stability without identifying individuals.

## 4. Sharing, Transfer, and Disclosure

1. **Third-party sharing**: We share receipt data with Apple solely to verify purchase entitlements, subject to Apple's developer policies and privacy rules. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with other third parties.
2. **Legal disclosure**: We may disclose necessary information when required by applicable laws, legal processes, or competent government authorities.
3. **Business transfers**: If a merger, acquisition, or asset transfer occurs, we will notify you before the change takes effect and ensure the recipient remains bound by this Policy or re-obtain your consent.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

- **Storage location**: Except for network requests made during receipt validation, all data remains on your local device; we do not upload it to our servers.
- **Security measures**: We rely on system keychain storage, security-scoped bookmarks, and permission controls to mitigate risks of leakage, loss, or misuse. Please keep your operating system up to date and secure your device with passwords or biometrics.
- **Retention period**: Data persists for as long as the Software operates on your device. You can reset preferences, clear recent records, or uninstall the Software to remove all local data.
## 6. Your Rights

### 6.1 General Rights
You may access, copy, correct, or delete locally stored information through in-app settings or by uninstalling the Software. For receipts or purchase history, use Apple ID's "Restore Purchases" feature or contact Apple Support.

### 6.2 Region-Specific Rights
- **EU/UK users**: You may request copies of your data, restrict processing, object to certain processing, or exercise data portability rights. When we rely on legitimate interests, you may object at any time.
- **California residents**: Under the CCPA/CPRA, you may inquire about the categories and purposes of information collected and request deletion. We do not sell or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.
- **Mainland China users**: You may exercise rights to access, correct, delete, deregister, or withdraw consent. We will obtain separate authorization before handling personal sensitive information.

To exercise these rights, contact us using the details in the "Contact Us" section. We will verify and respond within a reasonable period.

## 7. Protection of Minors

If you are a minor, use the Software only under the supervision of a guardian and obtain consent before providing any information. If we discover that we collected information from minors without consent, we will delete or anonymize it promptly.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Other than receipt validation with Apple, we currently do not transfer data across borders. Should future operations require processing in other jurisdictions, we will comply with local laws and implement safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or transfer impact assessments.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy to reflect service adjustments or legal requirements. For material changes, we will notify you through release notes, in-app messages, or other appropriate means and, when necessary, seek your renewed consent. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
