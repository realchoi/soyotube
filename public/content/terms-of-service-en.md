## 5. Trial and Payment Terms

1. **Free Trial**: New users receive a seven-day free trial. Once it expires, certain features are limited until you unlock them via purchase.
2. **In-App Purchase**:
   - Unlocking the Service occurs through your Apple ID via the App Store, with Apple acting as the billing entity;
   - Prices shown in the App Store apply and may vary due to regional taxes and exchange rates;
   - After successful payment, you can restore the purchase on devices using the same Apple ID.
3. **Refunds**: Unless required by applicable law, we do not process refunds directly. Submit refund requests via Apple's official App Store process.
4. **Taxes and Exchange Rates**: You are responsible for any taxes, fees, or currency fluctuations. We strive to reflect current costs in pricing but are not liable for exchange differences or bank charges.

## 6. Third-Party Services

1. The Software integrates with Apple services such as StoreKit and receipt validation. When using in-app purchase or restore functions, you must also comply with Apple's terms and policies.
2. If we incorporate additional third-party SDKs, APIs, or services in the future, we will notify you and obtain appropriate authorization before use.

1. The Software and its contents—including source code, interface design, icons, documentation, trademarks, product names, and derivative works—are owned by us or our licensors and protected by intellectual property laws.
2. You may not use, copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without our prior written consent.

## 8. User-Generated Content

1. You retain rights to the content you create or store in the Software (e.g., custom crop ratios and personalized configurations).
2. You grant us permission to use, process, and locally store such content as necessary to deliver the Service and enhance your experience.

## 9. Disclaimer

## 10. Limitation of Liability

Our total liability to you for any claim arising from or related to the Software will not exceed the amount you actually paid (if any). Because some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or incidental damages, the foregoing limitations may not apply to you in whole or in part.
